I created a class according to my option 17
Using the lombok library, it implemented set and get methods, constructors with arguments, a constructor for soaking and an overridden method toString()
The written class contains a public static method getInstance(), and a field static field instance whose value will be returned by the method getInstance
Outputs the identifiers of all objects from the array to the console using a loop with a prerequisite
I created the Hotel class, which has the following fields:
name: hotel name; totalRooms: total number of rooms in the hotel; availableRooms: number of available rooms; rating: hotel rating.
The Hotel class has the following public methods:
bookRoom(): a method that books a room (reduces the number of free rooms by 1, provided that a free room is available);
releaseRoom(): a method that releases a room (increments the number of free rooms by 1);
getAvailableRooms(): method that returns the number of available rooms;
getBookedRoomsCount(): A method that returns the number of rooms booked at the current time
